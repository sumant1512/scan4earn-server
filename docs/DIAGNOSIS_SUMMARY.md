# 🎯 Diagnosis Summary: Why Authorization Header Disappears

## TL;DR

**Your interceptor IS adding the header correctly.**

**The browser is STRIPPING it due to CORS configuration.**

## The Issue

Your server's CORS configuration at `mscan-server/src/server.js:53-81` is missing the `allowedHeaders` option:

```javascript
const corsOptions = {
  origin: function(origin, callback) { ... },
  credentials: true,
  // ❌ Missing: allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization', 'X-Tenant-ID']
};
```

## What Happens (Step by Step)

```
1. Angular HttpClient makes request
   ✅ Interceptor adds Authorization header to request object
   ✅ Console.log shows header is present (line 38)

2. Browser checks CORS policy
   → Sends OPTIONS preflight to server
   → "Can I send Authorization header?"

3. Server responds to OPTIONS
   ✅ Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, ...
   ❌ Access-Control-Allow-Headers: [NOT SENT]

4. Browser interprets this as "Authorization not allowed"
   ❌ STRIPS Authorization header from request

5. Browser sends actual GET request
   ❌ WITHOUT Authorization header

6. Server receives request without header
   ❌ Returns: "No token provided"
```

## Proof

I tested your server's CORS preflight:

```bash
$ curl -I -X OPTIONS http://sumant.localhost:8080/api/products

HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET,HEAD,PUT,PATCH,POST,DELETE
```

**Missing:**
```
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization, X-Tenant-ID
```

## Why Console Shows Header But Network Doesn't

**Console.log (line 38):**
- Shows the JavaScript request object in memory
- At this point, the header IS present
- This runs BEFORE the browser's network stack processes the request

**Network Tab:**
- Shows the ACTUAL HTTP request sent by the browser
- This is AFTER CORS filtering
- The header has been stripped by the browser

**Think of it like this:**
```
Interceptor → Adds header → Console shows it ✅
              ↓
Browser CORS → Checks preflight → Strips header ❌
              ↓
Network Tab → Shows request WITHOUT header ❌
```

## Why fetch() Works Sometimes

fetch() from browser console might:
- Use a cached CORS preflight from a previous request
- Not trigger a preflight if it's a "simple request"
- Have different CORS handling in DevTools context
- Work if you tested it differently

But HttpClient from Angular always triggers CORS preflight for requests with custom headers.

## The Fix (Conceptual)

In `mscan-server/src/server.js`, the CORS options need:

```javascript
const corsOptions = {
  origin: function(origin, callback) {
    // ... existing code ...
  },
  credentials: true,
  allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization', 'X-Tenant-ID']  // ADD THIS
};
```

This tells the browser: "Yes, you can send Authorization header with requests."

## Files Involved

**Client Side (Working Correctly):**
- ✅ `mscan-client/src/app/core/interceptors/auth.interceptor.ts` - Adding header correctly
- ✅ `mscan-client/src/app/app.config.ts` - Interceptor registered correctly

**Server Side (Issue Here):**
- ❌ `mscan-server/src/server.js:53-81` - CORS config missing `allowedHeaders`
- 📝 `mscan-server/src/modules/common/interceptors/response.interceptor.js:107` - Has the headers defined but not used for OPTIONS

## Verify Yourself

### Check Network Tab:

1. Open Products page
2. F12 → Network tab
3. Look for TWO requests to `/api/products`:
   - **OPTIONS** (preflight)
   - **GET** (actual request)
4. Click OPTIONS → Headers → Response Headers
   - Should have: `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: ...`
   - Currently: Missing or incomplete
5. Click GET → Headers → Request Headers
   - Should have: `Authorization: Bearer ...`
   - Currently: Missing

### Check Console:

Your log at line 38 shows:
```javascript
*****************📦 Requesting products with token: HttpRequest {...}
```

Expand that object and check `headers` - the Authorization IS there in the JavaScript object.

But check Network tab - it's NOT there in the actual HTTP request!

## Summary Table

| Location | Authorization Header | Why |
|----------|---------------------|-----|
| Interceptor (Line 32-36) | ✅ Added | Code works correctly |
| Console Log (Line 38) | ✅ Present | JavaScript object has it |
| OPTIONS Response | ❌ Not Allowed | Server CORS config missing allowedHeaders |
| Network Tab GET Request | ❌ Stripped | Browser enforces CORS policy |
| Server Receives | ❌ Missing | Browser didn't send it |

## Conclusion

This is NOT an Angular bug or interceptor issue. It's a **server CORS configuration issue**.

Your Angular code is perfect. The header is added. But the browser's CORS enforcement strips it because the server doesn't explicitly allow it in the preflight response.

The fix needs to be on the server side, in the CORS configuration.
